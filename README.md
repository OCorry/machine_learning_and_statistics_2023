## Introduction

This repository contains the the 5 tasks completed throughout the semester along with the final project required for the completion of module *Machine Learning and Statistics Assessment* as part of the *Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics* course at [Atlantic Technological University, Galway](https://www.atu.ie/about-atu/campus-locations/atu-galway-city).
</br>

## Contents of this Repository

This Repository contains the following:
1. A *tasks.ipynb* Jupyter notebook<sup>*</sup> - contains the 5 tasks to be completed throughout the semester
2. A *project.ipynb* Jupyter notebook - Contains the final project 
3. A ``.gitginore`` file which ignores any files that should not be commited to the repository 
        - For Example, the .ipynb_checkpoints is ignored - this is a file which Jupyter uses to recover work if it is lost.
4. A *data* folder which contains the two .csv files required for the completion of tasks and projet
5. An *images* folder which contains all of the images used throughout the notebooks 
6. This ``README.md`` 
</br>

## Setup of the Environment:

1. Download and install [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) programming language to carry out Python code 
    - Installing the full Anaconda version of Python which includes installed Python Libraries and  other           pre-installed packages 
2.  Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) code editor on which I have ran my Python code
</br>

## Set up of GitHub Repository

I have set up my repository titled **machine_learning_and_statistics_2023** on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and kept it public so that the content can be accessed publically. I included this *README.md* file and a *.gitignore* file. 
I then cloned the repository down to my own machine so I can work on it on my own machine. I did this by opening VS Code, pressed on ``Ctrl`` + ``Shift`` + ``p`` to open the command pallet. From here, I typed in *git clone*. This gave the option to clone from GitHub - on clicking on this option, a promt appeared to log in to GitHub. Back in the command pallet then, the list of repositories in my Github account appeared, and I selected the required one. VS Code then asked where to save the repository on my machine and I chose a location for it. 

 I have made regular commits back up to Github on new pieces of work I have added to the tasks and project. To push any updated work up to GitHub, again on the command pallet, I seletcted ``git commit`` and provided details of each commit. When this was completed, I selected ``git push`` from the commant pallet and this pushed up my work to GitHub.

## Interacting with my Notebooks' code

As my Notebook is made public, it can be accessed on my GitHub page. However, it is rendered in a static format so it can be read but it not possible to interact with my code. For the user to be able to interact with the code, they need to pull them down to their own machine. 

To do this, once the user is in the notebook, they must right click on the *Raw* button on the right hand side and click *save link as*. Then save the notebook as a ``ipynb`` file in desired folder on their machine.

Once the .ipynb file is saved to a folder in the users own machine, it can be opened using VS Code by clicking *File*, open file and navigate the the .ipynb file and click open. This opens the file in  VS Code and code can be interacted with.

## References

I have sourced the majority of my code from my Lecturer, Ian McLoughlin's Lectures and code.

All other references have been noted thoughout the notebooks and at the end of each notebook also.


\*Throughout the Jupyter Notebooks, I use the term *notebook* when referring to the Jupyter Notebook.
