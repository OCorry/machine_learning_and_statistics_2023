The data is produced in the dataframe in two categories, with variable names 'Drink' and 'Biscuit'. The data is in a [dictionary](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-dictionary/). The data is held in key:value pairs. Where the keys are the column names and the values are the data in the rows below them. The dataframe below is generated containing the 201 rows and 2 columns of data, where the rows are indexed starting from index 0 through to index 200 and the columns are indexed by the keys 'Drink' and 'Biscuit'."
