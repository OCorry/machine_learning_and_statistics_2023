This, with time will improve the accuracy of Artificial Intellegence, computer science and the use of algorithms for this. \n",

L, (n.d.)<sup>2</sup>, explains concept of Machine Learning (ML). She explains it as being a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) which focuses on building computer systems that learn from data. Machine Learning algorithms use data that we already have and use it as an input to train the algortihms to find relationships and patterns in the data. These trained algortihms then predict outputs, classify information, cluster data points, reduce dimensionality and help to generate new content or data.  \n",

    "Supervised machine learning (or supervised learning) is a form of machine learning that uses a dataset where we already have data in the form of inputs (X variables) and the corresponding outputs (y variables). The input and output data are known as labeled data [datacamp, (2022)](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/supervised-machine-learning)<sup>4</sup>. \n",

    "This labeled input and output data then goes through a stage of *training* during which the prgoram recognises or learns the relationship between the input data and the output data [Shee. Ed, (2022)](https://www.seldon.io/supervised-vs-unsupervised-learning-explained)<sup>5</sup>. Once the program has been trained using the training data, it can then be used to predict the output (y), from given inputs (X) on other data that it has not been trained on. For example in the case of the *Iris data set* once the program has been trained on the data set and someone were to come along with some more iris flowers data, the trained algorithm could be used to predict which of the three types of iris flower (y) (ie: Setosa, Versicolor or Vriginica) it was , given the inputs (X) data (ie: Sepal Length & width and Petal length & width).

A categorical variable is a variable that has a limited number of possible values or categories, and can be eithier nominal or ordinal [IBM, (2021)](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spss-statistics/27.0.0?topic=charts-variable-types)<sup>8</sup>.
